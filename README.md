A repository for **"An Analysis of Concept Bottleneck Models: Measuring, Understanding, and Mitigating the Impact of Noisy Annotations (NeurIPS 2025)"**.

This repository will include the implementation and noisy dataset generation used in our paper.  
We’re currently finalizing other submissions, so the materials will be uploaded soon.
